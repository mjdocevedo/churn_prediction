# Churn Prediction with MLflow

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to use MLflow to track and manage the machine learning lifecycle for a Customer Churn prediction task. We use the IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset to predict which customers are likely to leave the service.

## Module 1: MLflow Introduction 
The goal of this module is to establish experimental rigor and learn how to compare models using MLflow Tracking.

### Learning Objectives
- **Tracking Experiments**: Log parameters and metrics during model training and evaluation.
- **Artifact Management**: Save and organize model performance visualizations (confusion matrix, ROC curves) and the trained model itself.
- **MLflow UI Analysis**: Navigate the UI to compare different runs and analyze experimental results.
- **Model Candidate Identification**: Use documented evidence to select the best candidate model.
